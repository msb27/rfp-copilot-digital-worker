Title: Veeva Vault Promotional Material Compliance Guidelines
Version: 1.2
Owner: Regulatory Affairs / Medical Compliance
Applies To: All promotional, medical, and clinical communication materials generated or stored within Veeva Vault
Effective Date: January 2024

---

Purpose:
These guidelines ensure all externally shared materials, including proposals, case studies, and marketing content, meet internal and regulatory compliance standards. They apply to all content created by internal teams or autonomous systems (e.g., AI agents) that reference scientific, clinical, or performance claims.

---

Governance Framework:
All materials are governed under the company’s Promotional Review Process (PRP) and must comply with the following:
- FDA 21 CFR Part 202 (Prescription Drug Advertising)
- EMA Guideline on Information Relating to Medicinal Products for the Public and HCPs
- ICH E6(R2) Good Clinical Practice principles
- Company Policy QA-102: Documentation and Approval of Promotional Claims

---

Rules and Requirements:

1. **Claim Verification**
   - Every medical or performance claim must reference a supporting document stored in Veeva Vault (e.g., clinical report, audit summary, or publication).
   - Include the approved reference identifier immediately after the claim in parentheses.  
     Example: “Reduced enrollment time by 38% (REF-2024-001).”
   - Claims not supported by documented evidence must not be included in client-facing materials.

2. **Fair Balance**
   - When presenting efficacy, include corresponding risk or limitation statements.
   - Ensure balance in tone and emphasis; benefits and risks must appear within the same visual or textual context.
   - Example: “The AI-enabled system accelerated enrollment by 38% while maintaining full GCP compliance and data accuracy thresholds.”

3. **Off-Label Restrictions**
   - No content may imply unapproved therapeutic use or promote investigational products beyond the scope of authorized studies.
   - References to pipeline or pre-approval assets must be clearly marked as “investigational” or “not approved by regulatory authorities.”

4. **Submission and Review Timelines**
   - All healthcare professional (HCP)-facing or client-facing materials must be submitted for Medical–Legal–Regulatory (MLR) review at least 48 hours prior to first use.
   - Veeva Vault workflow status must reach “Approved” before any external distribution.
   - Urgent exceptions require written authorization from the Compliance Officer.

5. **Language and Tone Requirements**
   - Use factual, data-supported statements; avoid promotional exaggeration (e.g., “best in class,” “unmatched,” “guaranteed”).
   - Ensure consistency with approved corporate style guides and product labeling.
   - Avoid speculative or forward-looking language that could be interpreted as a clinical claim.

6. **AI-Generated Content Controls**
   - Any text generated by AI must reference pre-approved content blocks or claim libraries within Veeva Vault.
   - All AI-produced materials are subject to human review and Vault approval prior to external use.
   - Automated logs of AI content generation must be retained for 12 months for audit readiness.

---

Audit and Recordkeeping:
All approved materials must be archived in Veeva Vault with metadata indicating:
- Author / AI system of origin
- Reviewer and approver names
- Approval date and version number
- Reference IDs for all cited claims

Quarterly audits are performed to confirm compliance with the above standards. Deviations trigger a corrective action plan (CAPA) in accordance with SOP-QA-207.

---

Summary:
Following these guidelines ensures that all communications remain compliant, balanced, and evidence-backed. Adhering to the Veeva Vault Promotional Material Compliance Guidelines protects both patients and corporate reputation, while enabling efficient, transparent content approval workflows.
