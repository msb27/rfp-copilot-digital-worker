Version: 1.0
Owner: Digital Innovation & Compliance
Effective Date: June 2024

Purpose:
To regulate deployment of AI systems in clinical and regulatory workflows.

Requirements:
1. Model Validation – all AI algorithms must undergo documented accuracy and bias testing prior to production.
2. Human Oversight – AI outputs require qualified reviewer approval before external distribution.
3. Traceability – maintain logs linking data inputs, model versions, and outputs for at least five years.
4. Ethical Boundaries – AI may not generate patient-specific recommendations or alter source data.
5. Security – models and training datasets stored in validated, access-controlled environments.

Outcome:
Ensures transparency, accountability, and ethical AI integration within compliant clinical operations.
