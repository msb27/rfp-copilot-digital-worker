Client: Medtronic
Project: Post-Market Safety Surveillance for Cardiac Implants
Scope: Signal detection, adverse event correlation, regulatory reporting
Budget: USD 1.4 million
Timeline: 15 months
Compliance: ISO 14971, MDR 2017/745, FDA QSR

---

Background:
Medtronic engaged our pharmacovigilance analytics unit to modernize its post-market surveillance process for cardiac devices. Existing manual review workflows were slow to detect emerging safety signals.

Approach:
We implemented a real-time data-mining framework integrating FDA MAUDE reports, hospital EMRs, and service logs. Bayesian signal-detection models flagged early device-related risk patterns.

Key Results:
- Mean detection lag reduced from 180 to 45 days.
- Two minor device-alert updates issued proactively to regulators.
- Audit readiness improved through automated traceability.

Outcome:
The engagement strengthened Medtronic’s risk-management system and ensured continuous compliance under MDR and FDA QSR standards.
