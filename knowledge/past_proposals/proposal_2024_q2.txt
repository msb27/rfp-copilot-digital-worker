Client: Novartis
Project: Real-World Evidence (RWE) Study
Therapeutic Area: Immunology and Rare Diseases

Background:
Novartis commissioned our organization to support a Real-World Evidence (RWE) study aimed at quantifying long-term treatment outcomes for patients with a rare autoimmune condition. The project involved integrating heterogeneous datasets from twelve independent national and regional disease registries, each with distinct data structures, privacy frameworks, and governance requirements.

The primary goal was to consolidate these datasets into a single analytics-ready environment and apply advanced causal inference methods to uncover factors influencing patient outcomes that were not captured through traditional statistical analysis.

---

Objectives:
- Integrate multi-country registry data within a secure, regulatory-compliant data environment.
- Harmonize disparate data models and ensure standardized terminology using CDISC and OMOP vocabularies.
- Employ causal AI methods to identify confounding variables influencing observed treatment effects.
- Deliver validated analytical outputs suitable for regulatory submission and publication.

---

Approach:
Our approach combined domain expertise in observational data analytics with proprietary AI-driven modeling pipelines. The engagement included the following key components:

1. Data Acquisition and Integration:
   - Established data-sharing agreements with twelve registries across North America and Europe.
   - Ingested and harmonized patient-level data within a controlled-access AWS environment configured for 21 CFR Part 11 compliance.
   - Applied automated data quality checks for completeness, range, and logical consistency.

2. Data Standardization:
   - Mapped incoming datasets to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and standardized clinical concepts using SNOMED CT and MedDRA.
   - Implemented a metadata registry to trace data provenance and transformation lineage for audit readiness.

3. Causal AI Modeling:
   - Deployed a proprietary causal discovery framework using graph-based structural equation modeling.
   - Identified three previously undetected confounding variables influencing treatment adherence and adverse event rates.
   - Benchmarked model outputs against traditional regression-based analyses to validate robustness.

4. Compliance and Quality Oversight:
   - All data pipelines validated under FDA 21 CFR Part 11 controls.
   - User authentication, audit trails, and change logs maintained in compliance with internal QA-SOP-311.
   - Periodic data integrity reviews performed jointly with Novartis data governance leads.

---

Key Results:
- Successful integration of 12 heterogeneous registries into a unified analytics environment.
- Discovery of 3 hidden confounders missed by traditional statistical approaches, enhancing the credibility of observed treatment effects.
- Achieved a 100% data traceability rate through metadata-driven audit trails.
- Delivered regulatory-grade datasets suitable for both FDA and EMA evidence submissions.

Technology Stack:
- AWS-based data lake (GxP-qualified, ISO 27001 certified)
- Causal AI engine using structural causal modeling (Python-based)
- OMOP CDM v6.0 data model implementation
- Veeva Vault integration for document control and audit management

---

Compliance Framework:
All workflows adhered to FDA 21 CFR Part 11, ICH-GCP E6(R2), and GDPR standards for data protection and auditability.
Electronic records and signatures were validated under corporate SOP-QA-105, ensuring full traceability from ingestion through analysis.
All transformations and analyses were logged and version-controlled for reproducibility.

---

Outcome and Client Value:
The study demonstrated that advanced causal AI techniques can materially enhance the reliability of real-world evidence by uncovering non-obvious causal relationships.
Novartis obtained new insights into patient behavior and treatment efficacy, supporting both publication and internal R&D decision-making.
The engagement established a scalable, compliant framework for future RWE initiatives using AI-assisted analytics.

---

Key Win:
Causal AI identified three hidden confounders missed by traditional statistical approaches, improving causal inference robustness and regulatory confidence.
