Background:
Roche commissioned a real-world evidence analysis to complement ongoing Phase IV studies. The objective was to estimate long-term survival trends and evaluate treatment sequencing.

Approach:
We harmonized data from four oncology registries and two payer claims datasets using the OMOP CDM. A survival model combining Kaplan–Meier estimation and causal adjustment identified time-dependent treatment effects.

Key Results:
- Integrated 250,000 patient records with 99.6% linkage accuracy.
- Observed survival benefit consistent with trial findings.
- Provided evidence package accepted by both FDA and EMA for labeling discussion support.

Outcome:
The project demonstrated that high-fidelity RWE pipelines can extend insights beyond trial populations under full privacy compliance.
