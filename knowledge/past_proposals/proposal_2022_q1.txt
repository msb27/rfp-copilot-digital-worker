Client: Sanofi
Project: Vaccine Supply Chain Predictive Analytics
Scope: Cold-chain optimization and inventory forecasting
Duration: 10 months
Budget: USD 1.6 million
Compliance: WHO GDP, ISO 13485, internal QA-SUP-204

---

Background:
Sanofi sought an analytics partner to improve global vaccine supply reliability across 32 distribution centers. Temperature excursions and shipment delays had increased wastage rates beyond target thresholds.

Approach:
Our data-science team built a predictive demand model using shipment telemetry, regional epidemiology, and warehouse sensor data. Anomaly detection flagged deviations before spoilage thresholds were breached.

Key Results:
- 28% reduction in cold-chain excursions.
- Forecast accuracy improved from 72% to 93%.
- $4.2M in annualized savings through optimized logistics.

Outcome:
This engagement validated the benefit of predictive modeling in vaccine operations, aligning with WHO GDP requirements and enhancing global distribution resilience.
