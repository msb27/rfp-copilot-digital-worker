Background:
AstraZeneca engaged our CRO to design and execute a fully decentralized clinical trial (DCT) evaluating a novel lipid-lowering therapy. The sponsor’s goal was to shorten patient recruitment timelines while maintaining data integrity and protocol adherence.

Objectives:
- Enable remote enrollment and informed consent through secure digital platforms.
- Capture continuous cardiovascular biomarker data from wearable devices.
- Ensure full regulatory compliance with regional privacy laws.

Approach:
We implemented a hybrid DCT model with 60% of visits conducted remotely. The eConsent workflow was validated under 21 CFR Part 11, and real-time device telemetry was integrated into the EDC via API. Data quality was continuously monitored using anomaly-detection algorithms.

Key Results:
- 45% reduction in screening-to-enrollment cycle time.
- 97% patient adherence to wearable-device protocols.
- Zero major protocol deviations in remote visit documentation.

Technology Stack:
Validated telehealth platform (ISO 27001), eConsent module, remote monitoring dashboard, encrypted AWS storage.

Outcome:
The study demonstrated that decentralized designs can accelerate cardiovascular research while maintaining full compliance and data reliability.
